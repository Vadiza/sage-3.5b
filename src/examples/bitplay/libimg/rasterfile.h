 * NOTES:
 *  Each line of the image is rounded out to a multiple of 16 bits.
 *   This corresponds to the rounding convention used by the memory pixrect
 *   package (/usr/include/pixrect/memvar.h) of the SunWindows system.
 *  The ras_encoding field (always set to 0 by Sun's supported software)
 *   was renamed to ras_length in release 2.0.  As a result, rasterfiles
 *   of type 0 generated by the old software claim to have 0 length; for
 *   compatibility, code reading rasterfiles must be prepared to compute the
 *   true length from the width, height, and depth fields.
