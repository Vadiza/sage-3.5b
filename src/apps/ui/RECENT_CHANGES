HOW TO FIND OUT WHICH VERSION OF SAGE UI YOU HAVE
----------------------------------------------------
Versions prior to 2.5 weren't labeled so there is no way to find out version nubmers for those.
However, from v2.5 on, SAGE UI has an About Box that shows the current version of the UI.


CHANGES in v3.0a    (Feb 11, 2007)
-----------------------------------------
- this is the development version for SAGE3.0 (it's alpha since sage3 hasn't
  been officially released at this point)
- there are mostly minor changes... the biggest one being the change in
  dependencies (numpy is now preferred over numarray since numarray is 
  being phased out)
- autologin to a machine feature (with -a command line parameter)
- rotation of sage windows
- support for multiple physical displays in one sage session - experimental!
- some bug fixes (there are still some significant issues with MacOS)


CHANGES in v2.84    (May 15, 2007)
-----------------------------------------
- direct interaction with the sage display using joysticks
- the requirement for the minimum wxPython version has been dropped
  to 2.6.2 (the one that ships with Suse 10.1). This solves the problem 
  with non-functioning appLauncher admin tool on the earlier wxPython versions
- there is a timeout on the mouseCapture call when moving applications which 
  prevents capturing the system mouse on rare occasions


CHANGES in v2.83    (March 5, 2007)
-----------------------------------------
- the sage server now reports system and public ip addresses and ports for each fsManager
  therefore changes have been made to the server and the UI. System IP is the one reported
  to the applications about where they should look for fsManager.
- there is a "Remote Applications" button that enables you to start applications from remote
  machines and tell them to stream their data to the current fsManager you are connected to
  (this requires the appLauncher to report to the sage server)
- added the appLauncher admin tool from which you can control application launchers (needs wxPython 2.6.3)
- the vnc dialog has been simplified
- some older and currently non-working features have been removed (session playback, saving state...)
- bug fixes (z ordering, retrieving empty machine info...)


CHANGES in v2.80    (November 20, 2006)
-----------------------------------------
- this is an official version of SAGE UI for SAGE2 and therefore some messages have changed
- SAGE now does z-ordering so that has been taken out of SAGE UI
- appLauncher is used for application launching instead of fsManager so an xmlrpc connection
  is made to the appLauncher at startup to get the list of applications
- left-click on app button launches the app normally (w/o sageBridge)
- right-click launches the app through sageBridge so that the app can be shared
- sage ui will run even without the appLauncher running
- to stream already running apps either drag-and-drop the app onto a
  new tab OR right-click on the app window and choose "Stream To:"
  and select a machine from a submenu
- fileLibrary can also run the applications through sageBridge by
  checking a checkBox
- performance data is ON by default but it will remember whether it was
  on or off next time you start the UI
- fixed some issues with VNC password saving and other preferences
- VNC password is no longer encrypted because there were some issues with that
- performance data format has changed so now there are only bandwidth and framerate available
- when dropping the file onto the UI from the desktop, it will be automatically shown and
  it wont ask you whether you want to upload it permanently or not

- SAGE Server has changed in order to keep track of machines by their machine ID as opposed
  to just IP addresses... the new default ports are 15557 for SAGE and 15558 for UI clients



CHANGES in v2.72    (April 18, 2006)
-----------------------------------------
- file library interface changed a bit
- can connect to and use multiple file libraries
- shows metadata for the files in the library
- retrieves previews of the files (images only) - previews are cached so their retrieval is fast
- local and remote files are compared by size as well as by name
- some other file library changes and fixes
- file library can be stored remotely
- file library has another component, file grabber, that fetches data 
  from a remote machine (it caches the data locally)
- imageviewer and mplayer buttons have been disabled in the ui
- sage ui now has global preferences that are stored in binary pickle files as opposed to text files
- all the preferences files are kept in the prefs/ subdirectory of sage ui
- current preferences: usernames used, machines connected to, 
  vnc profiles, favorite files from the file lib, visual prefs (chat panel shown/hidden, 
  frame size and pos), file libraries connected to)



CHANGES in v2.7:    (February 13, 2006)
-----------------------------------------
- Drag-and-drop of the multimedia files onto the UI itself (the file will show up on the
  tiled display exactly where you dropped it in the UI). Currently images, videos and pdf
  files are supported.
- FileLibrary has been implemented - keeps track of, stores and organizes all the files that
  have been shown on the display. It also lists all the files currently on the server that are available
  for showing. It allows users to organize the files by directories and even save favorites.
  In order of this to work a File Server has to be running that is included with SAGE.
- The application performance panel has been redone (double buffered)
- A timeout when users server / connection manager is not available (5 seconds)
- Some speedup during resizing of the UI
- Fixed a bug that was showing total render data for both graphs: total render and display.
- support for easier vnc sessions is included in the ui (showing your desktop on a sage display)


CHANGES in v2.61:   (September 19, 2005)
------------------------------------------
- a bug in usersServer was fixed (if SAGE connected but did not send 
  a register message, it would stay connected forever)
- a simple tool "admin.py" was made to check and modify the 
  internal state of the usersServer. This should be used
  only when things go wrong so that the individual connections with SAGE 
  and/or users can be closed without restarting the server.
- in the SAGE UI, console output is now redirected to a log file "output_log.txt" by default. 
  In order to view the output in the
  console, check "Menu -> Options -> Show Console Ouput"
- since ListCtrl tooltips aren't working correctly on Windows and Mac, 
  there is now an "Info" button in the connection dialog
  that, if pressed, shows a dialog with information about the selected machine
- Info, Connect and Delete buttons are greyed out if no selection is made in the connection dialog
- last used username shows up first in the username combo box in the connection dialog
- data displayed in the performance panel has been reorganized and rearranged a bit to improve clarity
- there is little help question mark button in the connection dialog 
  that brings up the about box with contact information



CHANGES in v2.6:   (September 9, 2005)
------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug where sometimes machines were staying registered even when all 
  the users have left the room and the machine died
- fixed a bug that occurs when there is no hyperlink module in wxPython
- fixed a bug with tool tips in the connection dialog so now they show the correct IP 
  addresses even when there are multiple machines in the list with the same name but different IPs
- fixed a bug where menu items weren't getting updated properly when a new connection was 
  opened (when more than one connection was opened at once)
- fixed a bug that caused the UI to crash when the user who ran the UI didn't have write permissions
- all the usernames used to log in are stored locally in a file 
  and can be chosen upon startup with the combo box
- when starting SAGE UI, you can now specify the location of the 
  connection manager (port number and IP address)
- shapes now have icons in the top right corner for maximizing, minimizing and closing
- minimize feature was also implemented where apps keep stacking 
  themselves in the bottom left corner of the display
- ability to shutdown SAGE from within the UI (File -> Shutdown SAGE)
- saving and loading sessions is now handled through system dialogs
- clicking the instance buttons now brings that app to the front



CHANGES in v2.5:  (July 20, 2005)
---------------------------------------------
- the frame is now resizable based on the size of the display it is run on (and borders)
- the displayCanvas tells the current user @ machine (ie Username @ yorda)
- if the connection was unsuccessful, SAGE UI won't quit but instead 
  will show the connection dialog again
- fixed the ip addresses to that 1.2.3.4 is accepted as well as ico.evl.uic.edu
- added ability to change SAGE background color
- chat capability added with a room for every fsManager running... 
  and for "All"...detachable/resizable panel
- username login at the beginning
- the beginning dialog changed
- MS Windows draw problems fixed
- MS Windows dialog problems fixed
- optimized drawing a bit
- fixed a CPU hogging bug on MS Windows
- different app configurations now have short descriptive names (assigned in sage.conf)
- connection to multiple SAGE environments at once is now possible (with the same username)
- "About" dialog
- minimum version requirements changed (wxPython --> min 2.6.1)
- some minor bugs were fixed
