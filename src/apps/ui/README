                (version 3.0a)

(last updated on Feb, 2008)	




(1) REQUIREMENTS (none for binary distributions):
-------------------------------------------------

- Python 2.4    	(www.python.org)
- wxPython 2.6.2    	(www.wxPython.org)
- either one of the following (numpy preferred):
      - numpy     (http://numpy.scipy.org)
      - nummarray (it's being phased out though so SAGE UI has been made
      		  compatible with the first two packages) 


(2) HOW TO RUN:
---------------

- make sure that fsManager is already running on the machine you are trying to connect to
- run SAGE UI:
	
	FROM BINARY:
		Windows - sageui [options]
		Mac     - ./sageui [options]

	FROM SOURCE:
		Linux, Windows - python  sageui.py [options]
	        Mac            - pythonw sageui.py [options]
		      
	- to see a list of options run the UI with "-h" (such as python sageui.py -h)



(3) KNOWN BUGS:
----------------

- under some versions of KDE the background color of the panel that shows the performance
  data might look odd.The reason behind this is that the new versions of wxPython strictly 
  obey the current theme's colors and will not allow them to be changed by the application 
  itself. The issue seems to be related to the QT drawing used in KDE themes. Since GNOME 
  uses GTK (which is what linux version of wxPython uses for its drawing), it won't exhibit 
  the same problem and the colors will look normal.
