            FILE VIEWER FOR SAGE

-----------------------------------------------------
Author: Ratko Jagodic
Last Update: April 12, 2008




PREREQUISITES:
----------------------------------------------------

- python 2.3 or later
- wxPython 2.6 or later
- for ImageViewer: ImageMagick development libraries (if not already installed, these can probably 
						      be found on your linux distribution discs)
- SAGE must be installed already and the $SAGE_DIRECTORY environment variable set up



HOW TO INSTALL:
----------------------------------------------------

- type "make install" from this directory
- this will:
	- compile ImageViewer and imgToDxt
	- copy imageviewer to $SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin, file_server.py, file_server.conf, imgToDxt and dirToDxt.py to $SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin/file_server

- make an entry in the $SAGE_DIRECTORY/appLauncher/sage.conf for ImageViewer, for example (this should work in most cases):

	imageviewer {
	configName images
	nodeNum 1
	Init 100 100 500 500
	exec 127.0.0.1 imageviewer 127.0.0.1
	nwProtocol tvTcpModule.so
	}




HOW TO RUN:
----------------------------------------------------

- make sure the FileServer is checked in the SageLauncher and click START (it's checked by default)



HOW TO SHOW FILES:
----------------------------------------------------

There are three ways to show files:
(1) drag and drop onto the SAGE UI
(2) drag and drop onto the SAGE UI's File Library interface (press F2 or Options->File Library)
(3) from the File Library interface click "Browse" and select a file from your local file system

- by default, the file server will store all the files in the "file_library" directory that's relative to where
  the file_server.py is located. This can be changed in the file_server.conf

- take a look at file_server.conf for more information on how to add other file viewers to support other 
  file types. There you can also change file associations and change the default directory where the files are stored 
- you have to have file viewers registered with the file server (in file_server.conf) in order to view those types of files. 
  By default images are supported with the ImageViewer that you compiled above. Also, you can download and 
  install mplayer from the SAGE website to view a wide variety of movies.

- the ImageViewer will work with images up to roughly 10000 x 10000 pixels and for anything much larger than that, use Magicarpet.
  Actually, there is no theoretical limit on the image size besides the amount of memory but things will get really slow.



COMPRESSION:
----------------------------------------------------

- Imageviewer now compresses all images into DXT1 format which is 1/8 of the size of the original RGBA data. This makes
  the memory usage much smaller and allows for faster manipulation of image windows. Imageviewer by default checks whether
  a dxt version of the file already exists in the same directory and it loads that instead. If it doesn't exist it converts
  the input image to DXT, saves it to the current directory and streams it to SAGE. If you would like to show the original file
  instead of the DXT version, run Imageviewer with "-show_original" flag.

- if you have a file_library already with a bunch of original files in it, you can run dirToDxt.py and it will make DXT files
  out of all the images in the input directory. Make sure that imgToDxt is compiled and in the same directory as the dirToDxt.py.
  
  Run with something like:
	python dirToDxt.py image_dir
