VNCViewer for SAGE2

-----------------------------------------------



(1) INSTALLATION:
-----------------

- type "make install" (after you have already compiled SAGE)
- make an entry for VNCViewer in the $SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin/appLauncher/sage.conf file, such as:

VNCViewer {
configName MyDesktop
nodeNum 1
Init 100 100 1024 768
exec 127.0.0.1 VNCViewer
nwProtocol tvTcpModule.so
}

- don't worry about the Init line too much because that information will be overwritten automatically
  so that it corresponds to your desktop size


(2) HOW TO USE:
---------------
- from the SAGE UI click on the "VNC" icon and then choose "MyDesktop" from the menu
- a dialog will pop up where you can change some parameters: in most cases you will 
  only need to type the password to match your vnc server's password.
- click "Show" and your desktop should show up on the SAGE display
- to stop sharing your desktop just close the SAGE window for your vnc session from the SAGE UI

- by default the VNCViewer will stream your desktop to SAGE at 1fps. This is done to minimize the
  bandwidth usage but still be useful for sharing your desktop. However, this frame rate can be
  changed but you will need to start the VNCViewer by hand as follows:
  VNCviewer <hostname> <display#> <width> <height> <password> <fps>
